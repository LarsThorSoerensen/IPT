The Impurity particle trajectory code is to simulate the particle motion of a particle inside a fusion reactor
i.e. under influence of electromagnetic E,B fields
Was coded under a 5 ECTS special course with Anders H. Nielsen and Alexander S. Trysøe at PPFE, DTU Physics

Description of this repo:
Tungsten_IPT.pdf is the final handin from the special course
feltor.pdf is a pdf file describing the feltor code, mainly used to find a description of the feltor data

Impurity_Particle_Trajectory folder:
  - IPT.py the main code, written in python
    

  - ErrorPlot.ipynb

    
  - SanityPlots.ipynb

    
  - test.ipynb
